Things worth understanding in this codebase, with pointers. Newest last.

## 32-bit maths in a 64-bit language (`game/core/rng.gd`)
GDScript has one integer type, a signed 64-bit `int`. The hash and the generators are defined on unsigned 32-bit
words, so every step masks with `& 0xFFFFFFFF`, and multiplication splits one factor into 16-bit halves (`Rng.imul`)
so no intermediate product can overflow. JavaScript's `Math.imul` and `>>> 0` did the same job in the old engine.

## Differential tests (`tools/fixtures/`, `game/test/fixtures/`)
When rewriting something that already works, run the old code with fixed inputs, save what it produced, and make the
new code reproduce it exactly. The fixtures are JSON, so they outlive the old code. Random draws are compared as the
32-bit words they came from (`Fixtures.word`), not as decimal text, which can differ in its last digit.

## Invisible characters
The old `randomFor` hashed `` `${seed}\0${stream}` ``: a NUL character that a terminal draws as a space and that makes
`grep` treat the file as binary. When two implementations disagree and the code "looks identical", dump the bytes
(`python3 -c "print(repr(open(p).read()))"`).
